						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6ouJKdp.jpg" alt="Tom Collins">
						<p>Listen up because ol' Uncle Barbecue is gonna teach you kiddies how to make the most scrumptious Tom Collins. </p>
						<p class="hide" id="show-this-on-click">Now I know what you're thinking? Seems like a "girl's drink" well guess what? I don't give a damn. Delicious is delicious and everyone needs some variety in their lives. This drink is really easy to make and can earn you some major street cred making you the parties senior Mixologist. You get some lemon juice, some good ol Sugar (I prefer cane), gin, and club soda. Mix all that in and boom, Congratulations you just resurrected your childhood Goldish, Mr. Gills. Just kidding you made a Tom Collins.</p>

						<h2><a href="#">German. How to study abroad as a Broke Latino College Student </a></h2>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zo0bBxwm.jpg" alt="Korea">
						<p>Studying Abroad is quite possibly one of the best things you can do for yourself both as a young profession and as a global citizen but the costs can be as big as the journey so how did I do it?</p>
						<p class="hide" id="show-this-on-click2">The best advice I can give young Latinos who want to go abroad is, get friendly with your school's study abroad office. I'm on a first name basis with my alumni's staff. Why? B/c these guys know all the resources for getting you abroad! Also, write an awesome application letter that doesn't just highlight how great studying abroad will be for YOU but how you will use this experience to turnaround and inspire/help others to venture abroad. That's what the scholarship voting committee wants to see, your plan of action to make more minorities want to further their education.</p>
